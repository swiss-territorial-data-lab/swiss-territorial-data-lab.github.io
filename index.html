<p><strong>Clotilde Marmy (ExoLabs) - Ueli Mauch (Canton of Zürich) - Swann Destouches (Uzufly) - Alessandro Cerioni (Canton of Geneva) - Roxane Pott (swisstopo)</strong> <br /> Proposed by the Canton of Zürich and Canton of Geneva - PROJ-VEGROOFS <br /> <br /> <em>With rising temperatures and increased rainfall, mapping green roofs is becoming important for urban planning in dense areas like Geneva, Zürich and the surrounding areas. Green roofs, whether engineered or spontaneous, provide cooling, rain capture, and habitats, supporting biodiversity. Using national aerial imagery and land survey data, the study focuses on identifying green roofs and distinguishing among various vegetation types, including extensive, intensive, spontaneous, lawn, and terrace categories. Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been developed to detect and classify green roofs in two study areas on the cantons of Geneva and Zürich. Regarding the machine learning setup, statistical descriptors for the roof occupancy were derived from airborne images to train a random forest and a logistic regression predicting if a roof was green or not. Metrics on the test dataset showed that the best performance was achieved by combining a random forest and logistic regression models, trained with pixel statistics from potential vegetated areas defined by NDVI and luminosity thresholds on the original images. This combination yielded a recall of 0.87 for the green class and an F1-score of 0.85. The approach leveraging a deep neural network for classification of the roofs in the six classes of the project is still in development.</em></p>

<p><br /> <strong>Shanci Li (Uzufly) - Alessandro Cerioni (Canton of Geneva) - Clémence Herny (ExoLabs) - Henrich Duriaux (Canton of Geneva) - Roxane Pott (Swisstopo)</strong><br />
Proposed by the Canton of Geneva - PROJ-CADMAP <br /> <br /> <em>This project aims to vectorize historical cadastral plans using an innovative AI-driven pipeline. To overcome the complexities of plans manually-crafted by experts, the pipeline uses GIS software, computer vision algorithm and advanced deep learning techniques, such as deformable convolutional networks and vision transformers for automated map topology extraction and vectorization. The process includes removing background noise, deciphering symbols and improving vectorization accuracy using graph-based methods. An optical character recognition model extracts parcel indices and all information is combined in a spatially-referenced vector polygon format. Final vectorization yields a median Hausdorff distance of 3 pixels, while semantic classification of the detected polygons achieves an IoU of 0.98. Although most of the tasks are automated, minor manual corrections are still required to achieve satisfactory results. This semi-automated workflow saves at least 90% of the time required for fully manual vectorization of the entire historical plan. The vectorization of historical plans greatly facilitates the analysis of historical geographical data.</em></p>

<p><strong>Clémence Herny (Exolabs) - Gwenaëlle Salamin (Exolabs) - Alessandro Cerioni (État de Genève) - Roxane Pott (swisstopo)</strong> <br /> Proposed by the Canton of Geneva- PROJ-ROOFTOPS <br /> <br /> <em>Free roof surfaces offer great potential for the installation of new infrastructure, such as solar panels and vegetated rooftops. In this project, in collaboration with the Canton of Geneva, we have developed and tested three methods to automatically identify occupied and free surfaces on roofs: (1) classification of roof plane occupancy based on a random forest, (2) segmentation of objects in LiDAR point clouds based on a clustering and (3) segmentation of objects in aerial imagery based on a deep learning. The results are vector layers containing information about surface occupancy. The methods developed on a subset of 122 buildings achieved satisfactory performance. About 85% of the roof planes were correctly classified. The segmentation method was able to detect most of the objects with f1 scores of 0.78 and 0.75 for the LiDAR-based segmentation and the image-based segmentation respectively. The global shape of the occupied surface was more difficult to reproduce with a median intersection over the union of 0.35 and 0.37 respectively. The results of all three methods were considered satisfactory by the experts, with 70% to 95% of the results considered acceptable. Considering the quality of the results and the computational time, only the classification method was selected for application at the cantonal level.</em></p>

The goal is to generate high-resolution maps (10cm) to aid in the location and assessment of polluted soils. Towards this end, we utilize deep learning models to classify land cover types using raw, raster-based aerial imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs). Specifically, we assess models developed by the Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN), the Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD), and the Office Fédéral de la Statistique (OFS). The performance of the models is evaluated with the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) and the Intersection over Union (IoU), as well as with qualitatifve assessments conducted by the beneficiaries of the project. In addition to testing pre-existing models, we fine-tuned the model developed by the HEIG-VD on a dataset specifically created for this project. The fine-tuning aimed to optimize the model performance on the specific use-case and to adapt it to the characteristics of the dataset: higher resolution imagery, different vegetation appearances due to seasonal differences, and a unique classification scheme. Fine-tuning with a mixed-resolution dataset improved the model performance of its application on lower-resolution imagery, which is proposed to be a solution to square artefacts that are common in inferences of attention-based models. Reaching an MCC score of 0.983, the findings demonstrate promising performance. The derived model produces satisfactory results, which have to be evaluated in a broader context before being published by the beneficiaries. Lastly, this report sheds light on potential improvements and highlights considerations for future work.</em></p>

The produced point clouds are classified post-acquisition, i.e. each point is attributed to a certain category, such as "building" or "vegetation". Despite the global control performed by providers, local inconsistencies in the classification persist. To ensure the quality of a Swiss-wide product, extensive time is invested by swisstopo in the control of the classification. This project aims to highlight changes in a new point cloud compared to a previous generation acting as reference. We propose here a method where a common grid is defined for the two generations of point clouds and their information is converted in voxels, summarizing the distribution of classes and comparable one-to-one. This method highlights zones of change by clustering the concerned voxels. Experts of the swisstopo LiDAR team declared themselves satisfied with the precision of the method.</em></p>

Automatic object detection using a deep learning method was applied to SWISSIMAGE RGB orthophotos with a spatial resolution of 1.6 m px<sup>-1</sup>. The trained model proved its ability to accurately detect MES, achieving a f1-score of 82%. Detection by inference was performed on images from 1999 to 2021, enabling us to track the evolution of potential MES over several years. Although the results are satisfactory, a careful examination of the detections must be carried out by experts to validate them as true MES. Despite this remaining manual work involved, the process is faster than a full manual vectorisation and can be used in the future to keep MES information up-to-date.</em></p>

In this project, descriptors for the health state of beech trees were derived from LiDAR point clouds, airborne images and satellite images to train a random forest predicting the health state per tree in a study area (5 km²) in Ajoie. A map with three classes was produced: healthy, unhealthy, dead. Metrics computed on the test dataset revealed that the model trained with all the descriptors has an overall accuracy up to 0.79, as well as the model trained only with descriptors derived from airborne imagery. When all the descriptors are used, the yearly difference of NDVI between 2018 and 2019, the standard deviation of the blue band, the mean of the NIR band, the mean of the NDVI, the standard deviation of the canopy cover and the LiDAR reflectance appear to be important descriptors.</em></p>

<p><strong>Shanci Li (Uzufly) - Alessandro Cerioni (Canton of Geneva) - Clotilde Marmy (ExoLabs) - Roxane Pott (swisstopo)</strong> <br /> Proposed by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office - PROJ-LANDSTATS <br /> <br /><em>From 2020 on, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office started to update the land use/cover statistics over Switzerland for the fifth time. To help and lessen the heavy workload of the interpretation process, partially or fully automated approaches are being considered. The goal of this project was to evaluate the role of spatio-temporal neighbors in predicting class changes between two periods for each survey sample point. The methodolgy focused on change detection, by finding as many unchanged tiles as possible and miss as few changed tiles as possible. Logistic regression was used to assess the contribution of spatial and temporal neighbors to the change detection. While time deactivation and less-neighbors have a 0.2% decrease on the balanced accuracy, the space deactivation causes 1% decrease. Furthermore, XGBoost, random forest (RF), fully convolutional network (FCN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) performance are compared by the means of a custom metric, established with the help of the interpretation team. For the spatial-temporal module, FCN outperforms all the models with a value of 0.259 for the custom metric, whereas the logistic regression indicates a custom metrics of 0.249. Then, FCN and RF are tested to combine the best performing model with the model trained by OFS on image data only. When using temporal-spatial neighors and image data as inputs, the final integration module achieves 0.438 in custom metric, against 0.374 when only the the image data is used.It was conclude that temporal-spatial neighbors showed that they could light the process of tile interpretation.</em></p>
